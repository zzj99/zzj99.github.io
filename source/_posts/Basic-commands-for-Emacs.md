Emacs is not easy to use smoothly, though it is very powerful as one understands and get familiar to its usage.
I list some of the basic commands, and that's enough for my current need.

## Basic commands 

|    command  |  key-binding |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Exit Emacs  | C-x C-c      |
| Open file   | C-x C-f      |
| Save file   | C-x C-s      |


## How to use backspace in Emacs on Unix system: 

Add the line `(normal-erase-is-backspace-mode 1)` into `~/.emacs`.
